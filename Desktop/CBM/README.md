# click bain management system

## Inspiration
Ever wondered how videos with poor quality and content make it to the top of YouTube recommendation list?
Ever surprised why few videos always spoil your mood whenever you visit YouTube?
Ever puzzled by how few people become very famous on social media despite any good skill?
Well, the culprit is click bait journalism.

## What it does
Our chrome extension finds offensive and disturbing viral content on any YouTube page and warns the user to avoid the videos. Our main goal for this hackathon is to identify these click bait videos and change the titles to red color, warning the user to avoid these videos.

We built a model which learns from the user comments on what a click bait video is and then we did java script injection to change the traditional black color title of you tube to a red color one to warn user on the click bait content
